# sortingvisualizer
This is a simple sorting visualizer for a few sorting methods.

This was one of my first projects ever!

While sorting, the red bar represents the one that is being moved, and the green one the value that was on its place, the one it
was compared to.

The slider lets the user choose the speed of the sorting on miliseconds.
